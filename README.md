# MongoDB
### Example codes and projects for Udacity course <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud032">Data Wrangling with Mongo DB</a>
This repository is created for those who need ideas from concise code snippets of Python and MongoDB as well as those who are already or planning to take the course. The content is based on the topics in the course with 7 folders, one of which is 'Data' containing all the files for running the programs. The below are descriptions for each folder.

<ol>
  <li><b>Data Extraction Fundamental</b>: learning to handle CSV/Excel/JSON with <a href="">ERCOT</a>, <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/">NYTimes API</a>and others</li>
  <li><b>Data Extraction Complex</b>: practicing more complicated format such as XML with <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements.aspx?Data=2">TranStats</a></li>
  <li><b>Data Quality</b>: auditing validity/accuracy/completeness/consistency/uniformity with <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a> Major Cities data set</li>
  <li><b>MongoDB Basics</b>: using essential queries such as $match/$project/$sum/$exists and $unwind/$regex/$set plus many more with DBpedia Autos data set</li>
  <li><b>Data Analysis</b>: pipelining queries to fetch more specifically conditioned data with Twitter and Major Cities data set</li>
  <li><b>Case Study</b>: applying all the knowledge to the data set from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=10/41.8338/-87.7313">Open Street Map</a> for analysis</li>

### How to use this repository
For the course takers, I strongly recommend to try quizzes on your own first and then use my solutions only for comparison. The answers here may not be the best but have been tested to confirm that they work with no problem. Many of them are not exactly matched and won't work on Udacity cloud environment because I modified them to run on local machine. Some lines of code are also modified to further the tasks. I encourage you to make changes to yours to answer your own questions. For everyone, the following links will be useful as quick tutorials.
